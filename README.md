# SPEAR: A Simulator for Photorealistic Embodied AI Research

Interactive simulators are becoming powerful tools for training embodied agents, but existing simulators suffer from limited content diversity, physical interactivity, and visual fidelity. We address these limitations by introducing SPEAR: A Simulator for Photorealistic Embodied AI Research. To create our simulator, we worked closely with a team of professional artists for over a year to construct 300 unique virtual indoor environments with 2,566 unique rooms and 17,234 unique objects that can be manipulated individually. Each of our environments features detailed geometry, photorealistic materials, and a unique floor plan and object layout designed by a professional artist, i.e., we do not rely on remixing existing layouts to create additional content. Our environments are implemented as Unreal Engine assets, and we provide an OpenAI Gym interface for interacting with the environments via Python.

The SPEAR code is released under an [MIT License](LICENSE.txt), and the SPEAR assets are released under various [licenses](#licenses) that permit academic use.

## Getting Started

### Minimum and recommended system specifications

Minimum and recommended system specifications for the Unreal Engine are given [here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.2/en-US/hardware-and-software-specifications-for-unreal-engine). Note that some of the Unreal Engine's latest rendering features are [not available](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/tech-blog/unreal-engine-5-2-brings-native-support-for-apple-silicon-and-other-developments-for-macos) on macOS.

### Precompiled binaries

See our [latest release notes](https://github.com/isl-org/spear/releases/tag/v0.5.0) for download links. The easiest way to start working with SPEAR is to download a precompiled binary for your platform. Our precompiled binaries come pre-packaged with the scene pictured above. You can start interactively navigating around this scene with the keyboard and mouse simply by running the downloaded binary with no additional arguments.

### Documentation

- Our [Getting Started](docs/getting_started.md) tutorial explains how to interact with multiple scenes and our Python interface.
- Our [Building SpearSim](docs/building_spearsim.md) tutorial explains how to build from source.
- Our [Running the Export Pipeline](docs/running_export_pipeline.md) tutorial explains how to export our scene data.
- Our [Coding Guidelines](docs/coding_guidelines.md) document describes our coding standard.
- Our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) document contains information on how to contribute effectively.
