# InteriorEnvironment

This project assumes that `code/unreal_projects/PlayEnvironment` is already running successfully on your machine. See our [Getting Started](../../../docs/getting_started.md) document for more details. The project behaves similarly to `PlayEnvironment` except for one additional step. You are required to unzip `InteriorEnvironment_Content.zip` (obtained from the interiorsim Google Drive folder) into the `code/unreal_projects/InteriorEnvironment/Content` folder. Note that building and cooking this project for the first time takes a long time.
