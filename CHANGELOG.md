- A new agent, Fetch, that is capable of mobile manipulation tasks.
- A new example application, `open_loop_control_fetch`, which demonstrates our Fetch agent performing a simple mobile manipulation task.

- Improved behavior when running the `SpearSim` executable with no additional arguments. The default behavior is now an interactive navigation mode, where a user can navigate around a the `kujiale_0000` scene.
- A new tool, `run_executable`, which launches `SpearSim` in interactive navigation mode and loads a user-specified scene.
- An improved communication mechanism between the `SpearSim` executable and surrounding Python code, which more than doubles the overall frame rate when communicating large image observations.
- An improved navigation policy that was trained using our `imitation_learning_openbot` example application to collect data.
- Our macOS `SpearSim` executable is now correctly code-signed.
